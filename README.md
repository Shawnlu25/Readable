# Readable  

This is the Readable project, a content and comment web app, for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server and the frontend react+redux app.

To get started right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, install and start the pre-scaffolded Create React App project
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
